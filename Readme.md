# Dashbuster
Lots of folks have been sharing memories today (1-9-2017) about the iPhone being announced 10 years ago. While I didn't get started writing iPhone software until closer to the end of 2007, it was still a bit before the SDK and App Store.

In mid 2008, I landed my first job as an iPhone Developer (my first job as _any_ developer for that matter) with [Roambi](http://roambi.com) a stealth startup building a data visualization/BI app for iPhones. Turns out, in 2008 knowing _anything at all_ about iPhone development qualified you for a job. I can assure you - it wasn't my code.

I'm not sure I've ever shared this - for years I was nervous that it would show just how little I knew when I got started. 10 years later, and it seems my employers _still_ haven't figured that I'm still making it up as I go along.


#### I left the code just as I found it - it's amazing it worked at all.

##Observations & Notes:
* Dashbuster originally shipped on Installer.app - It was used by about 10,000 users.
* Dashbuster was _originally_ a Dashboard widget. Dashboard + Blockbuster = Dashbuster. (I think I've improved at product naming since then)
* Remember Blockbuster? How cute.
* I basically had no idea how memory management worked back then.
* I basically had no idea what I was doing at all.
* Apparently I felt the need to project manage myself - there's a "spec" I wrote for version 2.0, which was the official UIKit rewrite I eventually did.
* I added Netflix support when the App Store came around... I'm not sure there were any other dual service apps out there.
* I eventually retired Dashbuster because Blockbuster never had an API - and screen scraping was a total nightmare.


***Ultimately, I had no business getting a job doing this stuff. Dumb luck, a drive to improve, and a passion for building stuff that people could use helped me establish a career in the tech world. It's been a real pleasure so far.***
